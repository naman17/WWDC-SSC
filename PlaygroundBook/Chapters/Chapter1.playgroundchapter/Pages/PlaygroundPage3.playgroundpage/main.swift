# Sentiment Analysis
Another powerful feature we can use NLP is for detecting and analysing emotions.
If any of Nina's messages are detected to be negetive then I can help her take necessary actions and can even get a chocolate for her to cheer up!
 
* Important: This Playground Book is best experienced in Landscape with the LiveView alongside the code.
 

You can see the corresponding **emotion** that has been identified next to each text sent by Nina.

The model was trained with the [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) on **CoreML** and imported into Swift Playgrounds üòÅ

The below message seems be negetive, tap *Run My Code* and see if our NLP system can detect it!
 
*/
 var message = /*#-editable-code*/"Oh no! I am hungry :("/*#-end-editable-code*/
/*:
 
Try changing the message to something possitive like (It's beautiful today!) and then tap *Run My Code*
Once you‚Äôre done, let‚Äôs [head over to next page](@next) to know a little about me!.
