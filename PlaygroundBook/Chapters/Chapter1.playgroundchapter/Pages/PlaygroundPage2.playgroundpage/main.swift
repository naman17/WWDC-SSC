# Spam Detection
Nina is using the email system for the first time.
However she has started to receive some spam in her mails.
 
* Important: This Playground Book is best experienced in Landscape with the Live View alongside the code.
 
## Introducing Natural Language Processing
We will use **custom NLP models** that were trained on **CoreML** and imported into Swift Playgrounds üòÅ

It looks like Nina's mailbox has some unwanted messages. Let's set ``filterSpam`` variable below to true and try running the code. This will implement a model trained with the [Spam Collection Dataset](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/) and hide the spam messages so they do not bother Nina.

var filterSpam = /*#-editable-code*/false/*#-end-editable-code*/
/*:
 
Once you‚Äôve changed the ``filterSpam`` variable above to true, tap *Run My Code* to see the changes!.
 
Let's see if this works on new mails, Write a mail below which may seem like spam, or a good one. Let's see if the power of NLP can understand it!

 var mail = /*#-editable-code*/"Buy house fast for just 1$"/*#-end-editable-code*/

Tap *Run My Code* to see whether the model filters this mail as spam or not!
Once you‚Äôre done, let‚Äôs [head over to next page](@next) to check out some more power of NLP.
