#### Swift Playgrounds Book to demonstrate the modern RSA encryption mechanism using an intuitive game and a prototype safe environment for kids using basics of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to detect spam, negative sentiments and protect them from mature content online.

## Introduction 📝
- This playground book consists of three pages which showcase various use of technology in our daily lives.
- The first page uses SpriteKit to make a small yet fun game which demos the underlying mechanism of encryption in the modern world.
- The second page imports a custom NLP model trained in CoreML and uses it to detect spam and protect user from malicious mails.
- The third page imports a custom NLP model trained in CoreML to detect sentiments from the statements made by the user. It is used to inform the parent/guardian if the user is carrying negetive sentiments.
